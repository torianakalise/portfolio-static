                 <h3>Latest Projects</h3>
                 <p style="text-align: center">This semester was a course load that was difficult due to the Pandemic. With the transition to complete online virtual learning there were some adaptaions to be made; with that being said these were some of my personal favorite and some of my more challenging assignments. When I think of these assignments, I think about how they challenged me to use tools such as metacognition in order to complete them.  </p>

				<h3>Valley Trails </h3>
                    <p>This was a group project that I worked on with two other individuals, the objective of the project was to create a prototype of a funtional app using software like Axure RP9. This was a semester long project, where we continously made improvements based on a UX Design. We surveyed various groups of people and potential users for our application. The image used above was a still from the greeting screen from one of our intial prototypes.  </p>

                    <h3>Interview Video </h3>
                    <p>This semester I had to complete a visual storytelling course, where we completed various audio and video projects. This is a still from my personal favorite project, It was a interview of my roomate, we had to ask the individual a series of questions and edit the video to tell a story without it seeming to be more of that standard interview. </p>

					<h3>Learning Theory</h3>
                    <p>This course assignment pertains to my Human Resources and Development minor. We had to complete a five to six page paper on our own learning and how learning theory is incorperated in our courses we take. This was a challenging assignment because it asks you to take what you know about the theories and then see if any of your professors utilize them, and then not only see how and if they benefited your learning.  </p>

                   <h2>Photography</h2>
					<p>Photography is something I like to do in my free time, I like to explore the various things that an image can tell a viewer. I like to dabble in portrait work, landscapes, and a little pit of everything. I have taken a few photography courses, which I do believe has improved my photography skill considerably.</p>
					<p>For all of my photos I make use of Adobe software for editing purposes. I use applications such as Photoshop, and Lightroom. Additionally, I make use of a NIKON camera as well as my Iphone to capture images. </p>
